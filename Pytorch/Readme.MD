# 🔥 PyTorch Journey

Welcome to my PyTorch learning & exploration space.  
This folder documents my complete journey — from understanding tensors to building deep neural networks and deploying them in the real world.

---

## 🧠 What This Folder Contains
- **Basics/** – tensors, gradients, and autograd fundamentals  
- **Neural_Networks/** – simple feedforward, CNNs, RNNs  
- **Projects/** – hands-on mini and full-scale projects  
- **Notes/** – key learnings, code snippets, and insights  
- **Experiments/** – test files, playgrounds, and debugging sessions  

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Master PyTorch fundamentals and APIs  
- Understand deep learning architectures deeply (not just use them)  
- Implement core papers from scratch (step by step)  
- Train models efficiently using GPU acceleration  
- Deploy PyTorch models using FastAPI or Streamlit
